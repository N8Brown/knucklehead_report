# The Knucklehead Report

This is a Python-based project which aims to utilize the Python programming language to perform data analysis in an effort to identify what effects, if any, temperature plays in the effectiveness of a knuckleball pitch. This project aims to showcase the use of Python for webscraping as a way to gather data, as well as analyzing the data.

All pitching data for this project was obtained from https://www.baseball-reference.com/ and focuses on the career statistics of former Boston Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield, one of Major League Baseball's most well known and successful knuckleball pitchers.
